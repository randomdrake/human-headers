=============

Embed yourself in the very fabric of the web.

Human Headers is a project to let developers put a little more of themselves into their work without visibly impacting the web.

This proof of concept was conceived in a couple hours on the morning of February 5th, 2013 after visiting a website and simply wondering: "Who made this?"

Suggested headers:

* X-Human-Developed-By: randomdrake
* X-Human-Twitter: @randomdrake
* X-Human-Github: randomdrake
* X-Human-We-Are-Hiring: http://example.com/hiring

Download and install one of the browser extensions to start seeing Human Headers when you browse the web. Or, use the source here to package your own extension and use it.

With a browser extension installed, visit http://www.humanheaders.org for an example.
